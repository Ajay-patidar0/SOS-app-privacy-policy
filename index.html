    SnapSOS is designed to assist users in emergency situations by sending location-based alerts and connecting with contacts. However, we do not guarantee that emergency services will receive or respond to messages, or that help will be dispatched in a timely manner.
    </p>
    <p>
    The app's effectiveness depends on multiple factors including user device settings, network availability, GPS accuracy, and SMS functionality. Users are responsible for ensuring that permissions are granted and that emergency contacts are correctly added.
