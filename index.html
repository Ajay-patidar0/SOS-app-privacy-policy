    <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
    <p>
    SnapSOS is designed to assist users in emergency situations by sending location-based alerts and notifying trusted contacts. However, we do not guarantee that emergency services will receive or respond to messages, or that help will be dispatched in a timely manner.
    </p>
    <p>
    The app's functionality depends on various factors including device settings, GPS accuracy, network availability, SMS service, and granted permissions. Users are responsible for ensuring all necessary permissions are enabled and emergency contacts are correctly set up.
    </p>
    <p>
    SnapSOS also displays nearby hospitals using third-party services like the Overpass API (based on OpenStreetMap data). We do not guarantee the accuracy, availability, or completeness of the listed hospital information. This data may be outdated, limited, or inaccurate based on the availability and coverage of external APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
    SnapSOS is not a substitute for calling official emergency services directly. We are not liable for any delays, failures, or consequences resulting from reliance on the app. Users are strongly encouraged to contact emergency services immediately during any real emergency.
